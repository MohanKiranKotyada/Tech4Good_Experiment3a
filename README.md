I have taken 5 types of constraints and seen if the idea space can be explored. The first 20 ideas are generated without constraints, and the next 5 ideas are generated with constraints. The following are the constraints:
1. Cost Constraints
2. Age Groups
3. Extreme Users
4. Analogous Empathy
5. 2x2 Matrix

The results were a bit better than the previous experiments. Here are the details observations:
In all the 5 cases, there is a notable amount of rise in the graph, thus indicating a slight exploration of idea space.
Extreme Users and Analogous Empathy were the two cases where deviation was maximum when compared to other constraints.
2x2 matrix can be explored further since the rise was constant. Even though it was small, by generating more then 5 ideas there is a good probability that further idea space can be explored.
For cost and age constraints, even though there was less rise in the graph, there has been a single idea that was standing out from others (Point 25)
